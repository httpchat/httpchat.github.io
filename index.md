The spirit came to me in a warm, wet, autumn night. Rain was dripping down the drain outside my window and white reflected off my dumbfounded face.
`Ş͠TR͟͏̸I͠C͢͠T̵͢ ƯN̴͜I͢D͞͠I̢R̢E͘͜͟C̴T̸̛͜IO͏̶̵N̵̶̡A͏̶L҉ ̢͝D̛AŢ̛A͢F̵L͠Ǫ̛͘W̴̧͘!`, it proclaimed, pointing at the bright computer screen.

"whoagh?" I croaked, still in shock. `STR͟UCT́URAL̕ S͜H́ARING L͞E͏ADS TO SI҉GNI̷FÍC͟A͝NT̨ ̢PE͜RF̢ÒRMAN̸CE͏ ͏G̛A͞I͏N̕S̡` the apparition howled, making wild, sweeping gestures.
"I ... just want to make a simple CRUD app, I don't need --" `N̸O͠OO͠Ooooo̧` the piercing cry came (surely waking the neighbors), and with a theatrical swirl the specter flew into the coffee cup.

A moment passed. Then another. Uncertain of the situation (and worried about my coffee) I carefully peaked over the edge of the cup. `IM͟M̶U̵T͝A͘BLE ṔERSIS͡TENT DAT̸A̡ ͏S̀T͠RÚC̀ --` \<FUMP>. The plastic plate fit nicely on the forfeited coffee cup.

Satisfied I smiled, the silence my reward. Now where was I with the CRUD app?

`no̶͘oo ͝͠d̴͢oņ'̕͟҉t͢ ̵ù̵̴p̸̧̛d̨á̷t̵͞͝ȩ ́i͠n͟ ͏p̧l͠҉a͜͜a͢a̶̶á͢c҉e` the muffled sound came from the wet prison, now oddly glowing green.

"For fuck sake, I'll learn react if you give me back my coffee, whiny translucent bitch."

`i҉ ͟c̀an̴ ͞al̶s̶o͜ reco͟m̵m͜en͟d͞ redux̢ ̢f͘o͡r çǫnt͘ro͡l̡ling̡ t̀h̷e st̡ate̵ ̛in̛ ҉yo̡ưr a͝p̕p,̕ it ̶i̕ś t́h͜e ̷d̨e ͠facto̶ indùstry͝ ͞sta͢n̶da͘rd n̵o͟w̷!`

And so it was.

## [Jacob Tegtmeier](https://github.com/jtegtmeier)

Hey now! I am a IT guy and Web Developer living in PDX. I have a background in deployment of computer networks, technical support and freelance IT services for small businesses. My academic experience included Object Oriented Design and Web Development using Java and C#.NET. Currently I'm moving to JavaScript full-stack using Node.js and React to solve many of my challenges. I've gained valuable knowledge about many languages and computer science fundamentals along the way, make sure to mention me in slack if you have questions. Maybe I know the answer, maybe we both learn something new!

## [Kelly Robinson](https://github.com/kshimrob)

Hi beautiful humanz! I'm super new to the web dev world so thank you in advance for all the help. I'm currently freelancing and also learning at [Launch School](https://www.launchschool.com). I have a background in neuroscience and East Asian studies. Went from being a middle school math teacher >> managing STEM content at an [Edtech startup](https://www.albert.io/) >> graphic and UI design at the same Edtech startup >> fell in love with front-end dev aaaaaaand decided to leave startup to pursue this magical world ^_^

Besides [rolling around in code](https://imgur.com/r/gifs/TI8F7nh), you can find me trying to keep my hair sufficiently purple, letterpressing, screenprinting, sporadically teaching yoga, and writing songs on my ukulele.

I wanted to be Lebron James, but I was better at drawing than dunking a basketball. 3 years ago I found my passion - designing and building websites. Everyday I'm trying to be the King at it.

## [Amy Kotas](https://github.com/amykotas/)

Hello,  I'm Amy. I first started making websites long ago when we built them with tables and CSS wasn't even a thing yet, and worked for as a developer for over a year after college. Being one of many interests, I got away from it but found my way back to computers via graphic design. Design is great, but I missed coding. Right now the goal is to be a freelance WP developer, and possibly get into theme development (passive income, yo). I do most of my work before the sun rises because I'm also a mother of two young children. Grateful to have found Tania's site and to be able to learn from the rest of you in HTTPChat.

## [Francesco Boffa](https://github.com/aomega08)

Francesco here from London! I am Italian, 24 and moved to the City just 3 months ago. I do full stack Ruby on Rails development and enjoy frontend as much as backend and system administration. As a teenager I enjoyed low level system programming (C++/ASM) and developed my own OS. I am now looking forward at getting AWS Certified, and keeping a blog about it!

## [Thiago Cangussu](https://github.com/tscangussu)

Hi, I'm Thiago, from Brazil and this is my story. My father bought me a computer when I was 15 years old and since that I have a dream, to be a developer. When I was 17, I built my first website; it was 1999, and everything seems to be possible. But, I jumped into the wrong career and became a chemical engineer. It's been 20 years since my first computer and I'm not a developer yet. Some day I was on the Internet and I found Tania's site, and I read her story about how her changed her career and it inspired me, to go after my dream.
Now I'm here, trying to understand how things work. I don't know how to start or what I have to do, but in the meantime, I'm having some fun learning new things.

## [Curtis LaPrise](https://github.com/curtiplas/)

Howdy! I tinkered with php/html/js back in college and recently decided to really learn web dev again.  I'm sick of support side and operations side IT and I miss coding and development.  I'm currently working on getting my brand and business established EmberSmith llc.  I've also got a number of small projects I'm working on for passive income.  I'm still learning, but I'd love to help where I can.  I'm generally a fun sarcastic person.  I do most of my dev work during down times at my current job or after work once my son is asleep.
